# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The dataset has 1384617 observations of 131209 unique users.  
There are 15 columns:  
`order_id`: order identifier  
`product_id`: product identifier  
`add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to cart  
`reordered`: 1 - reorder; 0 - otherwise  
`user_id`: customer identifier  
`eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in  
`order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
n=nth)  
`order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed  
`order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was placed  
`days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA if
order_number=1  
`product_name`: name of the product, such as spring water, asparagus
etc.  
`aisle_id`: aisle identifier  
`department_id`: department identifier  
`aisle`: the name of the aisle, such as yogurt, cream etc  
`department`: the name of the department, such as produce, dairy eggs
etc.

``` r
# count aisles number
aisles <- instacart |>
  group_by(aisle)|>
  summarise(aisle_num = n())|>
  # order in ordered number to find most ordered aisles
  arrange(desc(aisle_num))
```

There are 134 aisles are there. The most ordered items are fresh
vegetables, 150609.  

``` r
aisles_plot <- aisles |>
  # filter aisles w/ more than 10000 items
  filter(aisle_num > 10000)|>
  # make plot
  ggplot(aes(reorder(aisle, aisle_num), aisle_num))+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_point(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle",
       x = "aisles",
       y = "number of order") +
  theme_minimal()
